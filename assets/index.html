                        For my first group project I helped work on an app that allowed you to search for recipes based on ingredients you had on hand. You could also save recipes to your profile and add them to a shopping list.

                        For my second group project I primarily helped with the back end of an app tha tallowed you to post blogs about your cat. You could also comment on other people's blogs and like them.
